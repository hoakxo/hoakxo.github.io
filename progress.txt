Started with layout.html, to make general layout of the page.
Using bootstrap for nav bar and customisations. Then using {% if session["user_id"] %} from finance, so when specific user is logged in, then they can view their personal dashboard.


Need to add something that allows user to register, login, logout in the app. Mentioned in the layout for button functions
